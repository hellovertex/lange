# From Blender to WebGL



I created an animation in Blender.

I want to display it in the browser using threejs.

I set up the camera in blender and from the properties tab,

I copy the camera location and rotation (XYZ Euler) from  blender to the PerspectiveCamera I created in threejs. I switch Y and Z coordinates and voila.

I manually recreated the blender camera in threejs.
